# YouTube Time Bot (ytimebot), Google Cloud Function

Create a photo message from a link to a YouTube video with a preview and the ability to set the
start of the viewing. You can also replace a localized title with your own description.

Send the bot a link via a regular or inline message and get the result. If you add time
after the link, it will set the beginning of the viewing. Any other text that follows the link
will be used as your own title for the video.
